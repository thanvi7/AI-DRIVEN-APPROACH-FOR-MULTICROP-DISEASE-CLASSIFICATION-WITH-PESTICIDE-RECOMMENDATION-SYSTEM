Plant diseases are a major threat to farmers, consumers, environment and the global
economy. In India alone, 35% of field crops are lost to pathogens and pests causing losses to
farmers. Most diseases are diagnosed by agricultural experts by examining external symptoms. It is time taking process of identifying the disease and providing the recommended pesticide
so instead of it we have gone through this project and want to bring it in the use However, farmers have limited access to experts. Our project is the first integrated and collaborative
platform for automated disease diagnosis, tracking and forecasting. Farmers can instantly and
accurately identify diseases and get solutions with a mobile app by photographing affected
plant parts. Real-time diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI)
algorithms for Cloud-based image processing. In our experiments, the AI model (CNN) was
trained with large disease datasets, created with plant images from many farms over 7 months. Test images were diagnosed using the automated CNN model and the results were validated
by plant pathologists. Over 95% disease identification accuracy was achieved. Our solution is
a novel, scalable and accessible tool for disease management of diverse agricultural crop
plants and can be deployed as a Cloud based service for farmers and experts for ecologically
sustainable crop.
